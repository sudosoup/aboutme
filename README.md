# Connor's .README

The objective of this page is to introduce myself and share some information that maybe helpful for us to break the ice, communicate, collaborate and adjust expectations effectively.

In it, I share my professional and personal values, what drives me, what makes me grumpy, and what my workflow looks like.

It will probably be useful mostly for my colleagues and collaborators (current and future) to read.

## Quick bio

I was born and raised in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma until I was 12 years old at which time my family moved to a suburban town in the east Bay Area, California. I completed my last year of middle school and all of high school in California. I think my childhood being split between the middle of the US and a costal city has given me a good perspective on life and allowed me to be more open minded about the world.

From a young age I have been exposed to technlogy as my father was a software startup entrepreneur growing up, I would spend many hours at his office as developers typed away at their keyboards. The apple has not fallen too far from the tree and I've always known that I wanted to pursue a carrer in tech. 

Activities that I enjoy today are swimming, cooking, gaming and watching autosports! During the pandemic I started a small streaming career on Twitch where I managed to make affiliate status and get an actual (small) paycheck from twitch for my viewership.

Prior to Zendesk I've worked at two software startups, one an enterprise search company behind Apache Solr and the other a saas startup for funeral home managment (morbid right?).

## Fun Facts

- I've been featured in The New York Times and on Good Morning America

- My first name is not Connor, it is my middle name

- In 2019 I unexpectedly stayed at John Mcafee's property in Belize, his last known residence before his death in 2021

## What are my favorite things to work on

- I enjoy working on new problems that do not have straight forward solutions

- I like creating video content and putting some of my streamer skills to use

- While I'm not the best coder, I enjoy spending time editing webpages or trying to understand how code works under the hood

- I'm passionte about good stories and like to give input when working with SCs on how to tell the best story for a demo

## What I value from others

- Directness: Let's get straight to the point and not beat around the bush. If you message me on Slack please don't just say hello and wait for a response before asking your question. 

- Growth mindset: Everyone makes mistakes, I don't care abot getting things wrong as long as we keep pushing to better ourselves in the future.

- Keeping it real: I want to know your most authentic self, I believe being honest and open can lead to better bonds with each other.

## What I think are my strengths

- I believe that I have a strong intution and quick thinking when it comes to problem solving and I tend to trust my gut when making decesions

- Doing the right thing, these are words that guide me and I always strive to make decesions and actions that are right even when it might be uncomfrotable 

- Explaining things in simple terms, I have a knack for explaining technical concepts in ways that people can easily understand

## What folks misunderstand about me

- Public speaking makes me uncomfortable, I always get a good dose of anxiety before having to present and prefer to have as much prep time as possible for presentations.

- I'm not a morning person. Despite having to wake up early often in my life, my body has never quite adapted. I tend to be fully online around 10am.

- I have aphantasia, or a blind mind's eye, which means I lack the ability to mentally visualize when thinking. I tend to think in more abstract ways that don't invlove conjuring images in my head. I think this can help me think of things in more atypical fashion but can also be a struggle when it comes to memory retention (faces are incredibly hard for me to remember, I'm much better with voices)


## Preferred Communication Method
I prefer Slack DMs for my method of communication, it allows for quick and direct way to comminucate all while being asyncrnous. If more depth is needed for the conversation then I would prefer a video call to discuss more in depth. 

## Working Hours
My typical working hours are 9am to 5pm PST every weekday. With the large spread of timezones at Zendesk, I usually accomadte by taking early morning meetings but I try to limit my early mornings each week to 2-3 days (see not morning person above). When possible working async is preffered since it allows me to function at my best.  

I try to not work late or over the weekend unless absoultely necessary, if I recieve a message during these times I will typically read it but not respond unless it is an emergency.
